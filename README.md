* I recently started running and cycling.
* Total cycling distance from this year: 118.83 km
* Total running distance from this year: 94.16 km
* All time cycling distance: 118.83 km
* All time running distance: 94.16 km
* My moto with this is to inspire at least a few people to start exercising.
* TODO: refresh token is hard coded currently. Make it dynamic. Strava can change it anytime.
