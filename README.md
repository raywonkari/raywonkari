* I have applied for a developer account in twitter.
* TODO: Once the account is approved, my plan is to embed my latest tweets here.

* I recently started running and cycling.
* At work, my colleagues used to form a team, and go out running every week, also some used to bike to work. I got inspired from them and took some time to prepare and get started.
* My only moto with this is to inspire at least a few people to do so.
* TODO: Embed latest activities here, instead of static data.
